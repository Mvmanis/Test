As Far As I Know and learnt about JWt is :-

JWT :- JWT stands for JSON Web Token. which is used to securely transfer information between two parties Or we can say, JWT is useful for Authorization and Information exchange.

JSON Web Token is combination of three parts with dots. These three parts are
1) Header
2) Payload
3) Signature.

JWT typically looks like
 
Eg. XXXXX.YYYYY.ZZZZZ

Its Benefits Can be :-

1) More compact: JSON is less verbose than XML, so when it is encoded, a JWT is smaller than a SAML token. This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

2) More secure: JWTs can use a public/private key pair in the form of an X.509 certificate for signing. A JWT can also be symmetrically signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm. And while SAML tokens can use public/private key pairs like JWT, signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security holes is very difficult when compared to the simplicity of signing JSON. 

3) Easier to process: JWT is used at internet scale. This means that it is easier to process on user's devices, especially mobile.
